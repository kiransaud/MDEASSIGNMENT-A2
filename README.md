Defining the new meta-model-

Since the last time when we we selected our domain as bank-atm-system, we have changed our domain a bit. We have made our domain more generic and we decided to go for Generic Financial System. Any financial institution like bank, insurance company, etc, can now be fit into our model. 

We have classes like account, transaction, financial product and their details which can fit into our model. 
The new metamodel can be found in https://app.genmymodel.com/personal/projects/_wIjwsJaJEe68OoIFaSTbiQ

For our A2 we will be proceeding with this new metamodel.
